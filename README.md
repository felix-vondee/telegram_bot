# Telegram_bot

![screenshot](assets/demo.png)

> In this project, I built a telegram bot that can be initialized from the command line. It is a relatively simple bot that displays text messages based on the commands entered by the user.

## What this bot does

- It can interact with the user when the user enters "/hey" or "/how_ya" commands
- It displays a random joke with your name in it 
- It can also display a random motivational quote 


### Acceptable commands

```console
/help 
```

```console
/hey
```

```console
/how_ya
```

 ```console
/init
```

 ```console
/bye
```

 ```console
/rdm_quote
```

 ```console
/rdm_joke
```
